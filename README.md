# [Face Detection App](https://face-detection-prce.onrender.com/)

This was built as part of the final project for The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery course on Udemy.

The goal was to create and connect an API, frontend, backend and database, which allows users to:

* Register an account 
* Login to their own page
* Paste image addresses into a field which displays the image with a bounding-box appearing around the face, that is detected via an API to [Clarifai Face Detection Model](https://clarifai.com/clarifai/main/models/face-detection)
* The users login credentials are stored in a database, where the password are also encrypted

## Built Using

* React
* Node.js
* Postgresql
* Deployed on [Render](https://render.com/)
